            <h2>Water problem in Africa</h2>
            <p>Water scarcity in Africa is predicted to reach dangerously high levels by 2025. It is estimated that about two-thirds of the world's population may suffer from fresh water shortage by 2025. The main causes of water scarcity in Africa are physical and economic scarcity, rapid population growth, and climate change.</p>
            <p>The current water crisis in Africa stems from lack of access to clean, sanitary water, particularly in the sub-Saharan region. Unfortunately, millions of people in Africa spend up to six hours every single day collecting unsafe water from lakes, rivers, and ponds, causing them to become infected with waterborne illnesses that either result in death or make them too sick to work or pursue an education.</p>
